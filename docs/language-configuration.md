# Language Configuration Guide

In the `lsp-client` SDK, language-specific configurations are primarily defined through the `LanguageConfig` class. This configuration determines how the client identifies files of a specific language, locates project roots, and interacts with the Language Server.

## LanguageConfig

`LanguageConfig` is an immutable configuration class defined in `lsp_client.client.lang`. it contains the following core fields:

- **kind (`lsp_type.LanguageKind`)**:
  Specifies the type of programming language (e.g., `Python`, `Rust`, `Go`, `TypeScript`). This typically corresponds to the language identifier in the LSP protocol.
- **suffixes (`list[str]`)**:
  A list of file extensions associated with the language (e.g., `[".py", ".pyi"]`). The client uses these suffixes to determine if a file belongs to this language.
- **project_files (`list[str]`)**:
  A list of "marker" files used to identify the project root directory (e.g., `["pyproject.toml", "Cargo.toml", "package.json"]`). When the client attempts to determine the root directory for a file, it searches upwards recursively for directories containing these files.
- **exclude_files (`list[str]`)**:
  A list of marker files indicating that a directory should _not_ be considered a project root.

## Project Root Discovery

The client determines the project root by searching upwards from the given file path until a valid project root is found or the system root is reached. This discovery is based on the `project_files` and `exclude_files` defined in the `LanguageConfig`.

The `LanguageConfig` class provides a `find_project_root(path: Path)` method that combines `suffixes`, `project_files`, and `exclude_files` for precise detection.

## Client Language Attributes

The `Client` base class includes several general configurations related to language processing and server interaction:

- **`sync_file` (bool, default `True`)**:
  Whether to automatically synchronize file content with the server. If enabled, the client automatically sends `textDocument/didOpen` and `textDocument/didClose` notifications when using the `open_files` context manager.
- **`initialization_options` (dict)**:
  Custom options passed to the server during the `initialize` request. Most Language Servers require specific configurations here to function correctly.
- **`request_timeout` (float, default `5.0`)**:
  The timeout in seconds for LSP requests.

## Example: Defining a Custom Language Client

To support a new language, you typically inherit from `Client` (or a base class like `PythonClientBase`) and implement the `get_language_config` method:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import override
from lsp_client.client.abc import Client
from lsp_client.client.lang import LanguageConfig
from lsp_client.utils.types import lsp_type

class MyNewLanguageClient(Client):
    @override
    def get_language_config(self) -> LanguageConfig:
        return LanguageConfig(
            kind=lsp_type.LanguageKind.PlainText, # Replace with actual language kind
            suffixes=[".mylang"],
            project_files=["my_project.config"]
        )

    # Other abstract methods like create_default_servers must also be implemented
```
