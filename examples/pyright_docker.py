# Example: Using Pyright LSP server in Docker for Python definition lookup
#
# This example demonstrates how to use Pyright (Microsoft's Python language server)
# running in a Docker container to find definition locations of Python symbols.
# The Docker approach provides isolation and consistent environment setup.
